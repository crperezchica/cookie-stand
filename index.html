    <h2 id="welcome">Welcome!</h2>
    <p>
    When I was growing up salmon was my favorite fish. I baked with my mother and everytime I would use my special salmon cookie cutter to make my family favorite frosted salmon cookie. 
    Little did I know that my love and interest for baking would grow out of my fish cookies. For the next 20 years, I worked on perfecting my baking skills and of ours my salmon cookies.
    My cookies were named the 1st best cookie oveall in the United States by People Magazine. Many of the judges thought my salmon cookies where the most creative and best tasting.
    So in 2000, I decided to open my own store to bring my delicious cookies to all. Today, I have several stores in the Portland Metro area and hoping to expand in the coming years.
    From our family to yours, Enjoy!
